# xyz

# Install some packages

Parcel should be able to install packages on demand. 

  npm install bootstrap
  npm install ol

Bootstrap wants this but for some reason does not install it.

 npm install popper.js@^1.14.4

# test it (from a cmd not a bash)

  npm test

Running npm test loads parcel (see package.json 'scripts' section.)
and the set up there launches a brower but this is the URL

  http://localhost:1234/
