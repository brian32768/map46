# map46/geocaches

This app allows you to use browser geolocation; when it's on, it will center the map on your location.

It also allows you to drop a file onto the map, and it will show the contents.
Currently the file can be in GPX, GeoJSON, IGC, KML or TopoJSON format.

## Other stuff

It shows the mouse cursor position on the map in lat lon and usng format

# Install some packages

Parcel should be able to install what you need using
because of entries in package.json.

```dosini
    npm install
```

# Test it (from a cmd not a bash)

```dosini
   npm start
```

This loads parcel (see package.json 'scripts' section.)
and the set up there launches a browser but this is the URL

 http://localhost:1234/

That's it!
