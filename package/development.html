    <h1>Building packages</h1>

    <p>
      What I am trying to do here is bundle a package for distribution and reuse,
    but still allow using Parcel to test and develop.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to be able to just write code and run it, the normal way for me is
    </p>
    <code>
      npm run chrome
    </code>

    <p>
      And to build the library for separate use.
    </p>

    <code>
      import fun from "myfunlibrary";
      fun("times");
    </code>

    <p>
      <i>Open the console (F12) to see if things worked, you won't know by looking at this page.</i>
    </p>

    I think I can do this by using a separate entry point + build command.
