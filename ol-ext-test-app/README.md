# layers

Originally this was to test the ol-ext layerswitcher
but it's rapidly becoming a test of all the ol-ext controls.

## Install some packages

  npm install

## Test it (from a cmd not a bash)

  npm start

Running "npm start" loads parcel (see package.json 'scripts' section.)
and the set up there launches a browser but this is the URL

  http://localhost:1234/

# What it tests
