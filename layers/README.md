# layers

Originally this was to test the ol-ext layerswitcher
but it's rapidly becoming a test of all the ol-ext controls.

# Install some packages

Parcel should be able to install packages on demand. 

  npm install bootstrap ol ol-ext --save

# Test it (from a cmd not a bash)

  npm test

Running "npm test" loads parcel (see package.json 'scripts' section.)
and the set up there launches a brower but this is the URL

  http://localhost:1234/

# What it tests
