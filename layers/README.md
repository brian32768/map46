# layers

Testing the ol-layerswitcher.

# Install some packages

Parcel should be able to install packages on demand. 

  npm install bootstrap
  npm install ol
  npm install ol-layerswitcher

# test it (from a cmd not a bash)

  npm test

Running "npm test" loads parcel (see package.json 'scripts' section.)
and the set up there launches a brower but this is the URL

  http://localhost:1234/
